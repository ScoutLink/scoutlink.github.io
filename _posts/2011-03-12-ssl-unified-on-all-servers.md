<p>&nbsp;We just finished deploying the new SSL certificates on our IRC servers. This means all servers now use a certificate issued by our own CA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are currently also deploying these certificates on our webservers so you can already use plenty of our servers now via SSL.</p>
<p>If you receive warnings you may want to install our CA as a trusted one. You can find the certificate <a href="http://scoutlink.net/cert/scoutlink-ca.pem">here.</a>&nbsp;To import this to your system you have to download the file and save it. After that you can import it to your Browser or Systems Certificate Cache as trusted CA.</p>
