<p>As every year registration during JOTI will be handled through<a href="http://jotajoti.org"> jotajoti.org</a>.<br />
<br />
What does this mean for you?<br />
<br />
You can no more register Nicks via the &quot;/nickserv register&quot; command. If you&nbsp; need to register an nick you have to do so via jotajoti.org<br />
<br />
All users that are currently registered at ScoutLink do not need to reregister. Their data ist already in the Website.<br />
<br />
Every user that registers on the website also will be automatically registered at Nickserv.<br />
<br />
In very import cases belonging to Nickserv registrations contact Techteam.</p>
