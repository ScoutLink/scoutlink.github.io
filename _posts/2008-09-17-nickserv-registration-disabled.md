<p>It is September the 17th and JOTI is not so far away, so we disabled nick registration via Nickserv. If you want to register a nickname from now on, please register at <a title="External Website: jotajoti.org" target="_blank" href="http://www.jotajoti.org">jotajoti.org</a>, your nick is then registered automatically at nickserv. Users that already have an registered nick at ScoutLink could login there with the same password and username as they use at nickserv. Some weeks after JOTI the registration via IRC will be reenabled.</p>
