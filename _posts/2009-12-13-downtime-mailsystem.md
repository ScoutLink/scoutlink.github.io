<p>Currently our mailsystem is not working. Reason is a hardware failure on the server we use for it. The Backup system also has some issues atm.</p>
<p>We are working together with the datacenter staff to get this problem fixed very soon. If everything works well our system should be back in about 24 hours from now (13.12.2009- 18:44).</p>
<p>Update Mon 12 - 14 -&nbsp; 2009 19:50 CET:</p>
<p>The crashed harddisk was replaced by an new one. We are currently workin on getting our backups restored. This takes some time. It may take about one more day to get the mail system.<br />
Don't ask me how much time it will take to restore all my data on that server as it is also my private one...</p>
<p>BTW: No irc related systems are offline. Only our scoutlink mailsystem is not working atm.</p>
<p>Update Wed 12-16-2009 7:45 CET:</p>
<p>Core mailingsystem is back up and running since yesterday afternoon. There not yet all aliases added but most are there. Mailinglists and incoming mail to techteam is not working yet.</p>
