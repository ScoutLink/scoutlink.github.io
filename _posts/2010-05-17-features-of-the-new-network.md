<p>Most of you already heard it: we will switch to a new ircd software and new services. The first question often asked is: why? This article should explain some of the reasons why we switch to the new network.</p>
<h2>Security:</h2>
<p>The old (current ircd as of writing this) ircd is no more maintained by its developers. This means there are no more security updates and also no new features that we would like to have. The new software is actively developed and easy to extend. </p>
<p>One thing we always kept in mind while designing the net network was security for our users. That is the reason why now every server supports connections via SSL/TLS and all servers are linked together via encrypted connections. This makes sure your data is safe on its way through the whole network.</p>
<p>To improve your privacy hosts are now cloaked. This means other users on the network will not be able to determine your ip adress.</p>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<p>Most of the new features are interesting for operators as they make their life easier, especially during JOTI but there are also some notable things that every user can use. It is now possible that you have multiple nicknames registered to one account.&nbsp;This means you are able to share all rights and settings (like password) for all thoes nicks. If you change your password it is automatically changed for all other nicks.<br />
You forgot your password? There is no more need to bother an operator with your problem, just request a new one via NickServ and you will recieve an mail with a new.<br />
The internet of the future: IPv6 - You are now able to use ScoutLink via IPv6</p>
<h2>Management:</h2>
<p>Most of the work we do is happeing in the background and nobody ever notifies what we do. While working on the new network (Codename Swordfish) we also changed some internal processes and built a own software that allows us to perform a lot of managment tasks fast and easy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In future we will release some more articles in the blog which describe the improvements in detail and show you how to use.</p>
