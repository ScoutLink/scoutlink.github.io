<p>We had 124243 connects during Saturday, please remember when reading that huge number that normally users connect more than once a day. We have currently&nbsp; 4554 concurrent connctions. The maximum we 've reached today ( i think that also will be the peak for the JOTI this year) was 5478 concurrent connections.</p>
<p>I again attach the IRC-Chan Graph for last 24 hours. Please remember that this Bot is collecting data only sometimes so the count the Graph shows differs from the data i have provided above.</p>

<p>NetSplit.de also collects statistical data from our network, and also uses a bot that connects sometimes to the network.</p>
