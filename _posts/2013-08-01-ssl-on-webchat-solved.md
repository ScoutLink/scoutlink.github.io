title: SSL on Webchat [Solved]

<p>&nbsp;The SSL Certificate on webchat.scoutlink.net expired. Due to some planned changes to the platform and a few other issues the certifcate won't be renewed for now.</p>
<p>We are looking for a long term solution, but for sure we will find a way before JOTI 2013. &nbsp;So as long the certificate has the following SHA-256 Hash everything is still okay.</p>

<p>We are working on a solution</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>
It took a while, but now we have again a valid SSL certificate, we are now also supporting so called "perfect forward secrecy". <br/>
Oh, and we also have a completely new webchat system :)
