<p>Today we enabled a brand new webchat for this years JOTI. It is reachable at <a href="https://webchat.scoutlink.net/">webchat.scoutlink.net</a></p>
<h3>Embedding</h3>
<p>If you want you can embed it via an iframe to your website and also preset the channel and nickname. Here's a example <br />
<i>https://webchat.scoutlink.net/chat/?nick=foobar#channel</i></p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The webchat uses always an encrypted https connection. To make it even more secure we added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy">perfect forward secrecy</a>. (Some more encryption details can be found <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=webchat.scoutlink.net">here</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>The chat is translated in <a href="https://github.com/prawnsalad/KiwiIRC/blob/master/client/assets/src/translations/translations.json">many languages</a>. If yours is missing send a note to TechTeam and we might give you access to the translation system.<br />
We are also maintaing a table of languages which could be directly mapped to a channel. So if your channel isn't preselected automatically (and it exists on IRC), also send us a short note so we can add it.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>We are aware that not yet everything is perfect. We are working on making the software better, so there will be some small changes in the next days.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>powered by</h3>
<p>We are running a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/prawnsalad/KiwiIRC/">KiwiIRC</a>. Depending on the load the set-up is split across some servers. As frontend we use nginx for load balancing and SSL termination. The software itself is running on nodejs. The deployment to the nodes is handle via <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest to use a modern Browser (eg. latest Firefox or Chrome). Some older Browsers and possibly the Internet Explorer could have sometimes issues.</p>
<h3>Thanks</h3>
<p>We did not develop the software on our own. Basically we just wrote some plugins and did some modifications and built a lot of stuff to scale and deploy. If you think that webchat is awesome and want an even better one, please consider to donate to its <a href="https://github.com/prawnsalad">developer</a>. <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/donate">Donate here</a></p>
