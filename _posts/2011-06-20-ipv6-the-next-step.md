<p>Everybody who wants to be present in the internet of the future needs to be reachable also via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv6">IPv6</a>. ScoutLink is having IPv6 enabled IRC servers already for a longer time. As we are trying to improve IPv6 support on our network we now have extended our infrastructure a bit. So the current IPv6 status is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>3 IRC&nbsp;servers reachable via IPv6 (use <em>chat.ipv6.scoutlink.net</em> to connect to them)</li>
    <li>Our DNS servers are reachable via two independent IPv6 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_%28Internet%29">AS</a></li>
    <li>The mailserver is also reachable via IPv6</li>
</ul>
<p>So we are already offering more services via IPv6 as many other organisations do, but we still want to add a bit more. To achieve this we need the help of server owners, and many others. So it will still take some time until I can announce here that we are fully reachable via IPv6.</p>
<p>BTW: One other thing, all ouf our servers are SSL&nbsp;enabled. So you can connect to ScoutLink in a secure way. The port for IRC-SSL is 6697.</p>
