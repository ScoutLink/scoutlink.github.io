<p>I've changed some parts of the code, updated the CSS file and did nothing to the RSS-Feeds. But now all of them are validated. So every (standard compliant!!!) Browser should be able to view the page correct. That's a big step to give every user the chance to see the page as it should be.</p> <p>Due to that that i do not have Windows on my Computer i have not tested the page with the non standard compliant Microsoft Internet Explorer, so if there are problems viewing this site, blame microsoft or peter, but not me. Becaus the code is correct. So now we are allowed to use the following images on our page:</p>   <p><a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">         <img alt="CSS ist valide!" src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss" style="border: 0pt none ; width: 88px; height: 31px;" /></a><a href="http://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=http%3A//test.scoutlink.net/rss.xml"><img title="Validate my RSS feed" alt="[Valid RSS]" src="http://validator.w3.org/feed/images/valid-rss.png" /></a>&nbsp;     <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"><img height="31" width="88" alt="Valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional" src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10" /></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
