<p>This post should give some information about what happened in the last weeks.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago we got information that some of our main server will not be available anymore from oct 1st. At this point we had about one week to that deadline.<br />
So we startet do backup all data on that systems and begang installing the services they hosted at other machines. As we get all our machines sponsored we do not have a lot of them and it was not easy to find systems where we could host our services.</p>
<p>As there are quite complex systems in background it took some time to install all of them new. So we moved our whole DNS, mail, issue tracking system and updated or added some other things. So techies did not have a lot time to sleep.</p>
<p>Right now everything is back running and we are confident that we are well prepared for JOTI. We will need to move the mailsystem again but this will be a silent switchover so you shouldn't even notice it.</p>
<p>At this point i wan't to thank especially all TechTeam members and all the people who helped us getting things done (there are many of them).</p>
