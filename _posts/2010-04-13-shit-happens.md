Sometimes there are strange, or almost shocking messages if you login on servers that are provided for ScoutLink. But thats real hard stuff:

<i>

local kernel: CPU0: Temperature above threshold
</i>

This happened while compiling a software module. To not kill the machine i stopped compiling and started some minutes later again.
