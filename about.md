Our TechTeam looks after the servers that the ScoutLink Network is hosted on, and keeps everything up-to-date, and running as smoothly as possible. Some examples of the jobs we do are: maintaining DNS entries, coding and configuring IRC-Servers and services, and managing the network’s mailing systems.

If you are having a technical problem on the network, you can let us know via e-mail on the TechTeam Ticket System. This system keeps track of all the e-mails we are sent so we can resolve your problem as quickly as possible. Go to Contact Us page if you need to find out more.

If you’d like to join us, please send an email to one of our coordinators. Members of the TechTeam have a difficult job, and we usually take on new members on a trial basis initially, to make sure they are able to keep up with the workload, and with limited access so they do not damage any of our systems.

All our operators, coordinators and team members have a nickname@scoutlink.net e-mail address. All you have to do is replace ‘nickname’ with their actual nickname, as above.

Announcements regarding Network Status and issues can be found at our Twitter account.

Please do not contact individual Coordinators about technical problems – use the ticket-system on the Contact Us page to get the quickest response and to ensure we can keep track of your e-mail.
