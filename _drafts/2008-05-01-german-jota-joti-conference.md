<p>At the moment I'm at the German(speaking) JOTA-JOTI Conference at K&ouml;niz (near Bern, Switzerland). I try to work on the page, but erm, can some one give me a more stable internet connection than a public hotspot connect to an macbook pro which is connect to an linksys router and then my absolutely stable thinkpad?</p><p>By the way, i'm searching for scoutlink logos etc...</p>
